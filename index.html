	<p>Although we judge cats for being lazy, and never craving attention, they make amazing pets, and offer their companionship for... food.</p> 
	<p>Did you know that cats were found by the Ancient Egyptions? Plentiful rodents most likely draw the wild felines into human communities. The catsâ€™ skill in killing the rodents may have earned them affectionate attention from the humans... then they started worshipping a cat goddess.</p>
